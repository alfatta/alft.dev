Ok, in this post i will share how i setup my Manjaro system as my programming daily driver. Manjaro is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system so installing software can be done with AUR repository. In this setup i use XFCE desktop environtment, you can download from [here](https://manjaro.org/download/official/xfce/)

First step is to set mirror repo to fastest one and update all installed software

```bash
# Set mirror
sudo pacman-mirrors -f 10

# Update from fresh install
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

Then I install git to able install from AUR

```bash
# Install git to able install from aur
sudo pacman -S git
```

For easy install software i use yay as AUR helper.

```bash
# Installing yay
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay
```

I prefer using zsh rather than bash, because it has such a good feature. And as always i must use oh-my-zsh package to improve it.

```bash
# Install zsh
yay -S zsh zsh-completions
```

For installing oh-my-zsh simply do

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

it will install oh-my-zsh from its github via curl

Then i install some software that i will use. In this step i devide my list in to 2 step which first is software from manjaro repo, and last is software from AUR. It usefull when sometime i had an error.

```bash
# Install software available @ repo
yay -S composer dbeaver discord elasticsearch gimp gparted htop inkscape jdk-openjdk jre-openjdk jre-openjdk-headless kdenlive kibana konsole mpv nvm redis screenfetch simplescreenrecorder steam-manjaro ttf-fira-code youtube-dl

# Install software from aur
yay -S android-studio anydesk-bin google-chrome insomnia postman robo3t-bin scrcpy visual-studio-code-bin wps-office xdman zoom
```

So, i've mention it before that this setup is for NodeJs stack programming. Then i must install NodeJs it self. I prefer install it with nvm, so i can switch multiple NodeJs version if i must. I've installed nvm in previous step when i install some software.

```bash
# Install NodeJs latest lts version via nvm
nvm install --lts
```

Then i install NodeJs global package that often i use

```bash
# Install some npm package globally
npm i -g @vue/cli firebase-tools live-server node-sass nodemon pm2 vuepress
```

Then i install some Visual Studio Code extension to help me code

```bash
# Install vscode extension
code --install-extension anjali.clipboard-history
code --install-extension ritwickdey.live-sass
code --install-extension burkeholland.simple-react-snippets
code --install-extension octref.vetur
code --install-extension eamodio.gitlens
code --install-extension ritwickdey.liveserver
code --install-extension robbowen.synthwave-vscode
```

Last i setup my configuration by setting ssh config file, vscode config, .zshrc includes my cli aliases, etc.

Thats how i setup my programming pc. Hope will help you, thanks...
